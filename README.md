🚀 DevOps Basics: A Must-Know for Modern Developers! 🛠️

As the demand for faster, more reliable software grows, DevOps has become a critical part of the software development lifecycle.

Here are the basics of DevOps that every aspiring developer should know:

🔹 DevOps = Development + Operations
It's a culture and set of practices that bridge the gap between software development and IT operations.

🔹 Key Goals
✅ Faster delivery
✅ Continuous improvement
✅ Better collaboration
✅ Automation at every stage

🔹 Core Concepts:

    CI/CD (Continuous Integration & Delivery)

    Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

    Monitoring & Logging

    Containerization (Docker)

    Configuration Management (Ansible, Puppet)

    Version Control (Git)

    Cloud Platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

💡 DevOps is not a tool, it's a mindset.

🔧 Tools don't make DevOps — collaboration, feedback, and automation do.

If you're a Java Backend Developer, learning DevOps can supercharge your deployment skills and open doors to SRE, Cloud, and Platform Engineering roles!
